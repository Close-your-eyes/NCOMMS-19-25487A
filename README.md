Here you can find the code for reproducing **Figure 1** from our
manuscript.

This repository only contains the R code, the data from the original
publication have to be downloaded from NCBIs [Gene Expression
Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

[Kubli et. al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10619-w) have
their data deposited under
[GSE130287](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE130287).
[Riedel et. al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16464-6) have
their data deposited under
[GSE140133](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140133).

If you want to reproduce r\_script.R on your local computer, download
the deposited data and have the required files organized as indicated in
r\_markdown.html.

The r\_script.R file contains the actual code. r\_markdown.Rmd creates
the r\_markdown.html from it.

To quickly view the code and its output, simply download
r\_markdown.html and have it opened by a browser of your choice.
